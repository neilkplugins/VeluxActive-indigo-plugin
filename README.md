# VeluxActive-indigo-plugin
Support for the Velux Active Gateway
And Indigo Plugin that provides support for the Velux Active Gateway and the [KIG 300 app control package](https://www.velux.co.uk/products/electrical-roof-windows/velux-app-control), this in my case replaces a number of individual modules and associated Z Wave relays with a single gateway box and with the bonus of app and homekit support.

I only have the solar blinds, so the initial version only supports these devices, but should someone have Windows or Shutters then this should be easy to add, but you will need to provide me with sample responses and take part in testing.

For setup see the [wiki](https://github.com/neilkplugins/VeluxActive-indigo-plugin/wiki).
